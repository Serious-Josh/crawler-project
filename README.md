This started out as a final project for a CS course I took which I turned in pretty bare bones of what my dream draft was. After a while I decided to work on it again as a little personal project. I don't have any final plans on what I want it to end up being, so I'll just let scope creep take my soul and "crawler" will essentially be in development until I decide I no longer enjoy working on it or it becomes so much of a beast I can't do more with it.

I have only one rule set for this project:

>No external code

I want every line of code in this project to be mine. My goal is to learn and explore as much as I can.

I have a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ZKiOcDwN/crawler-project-roadmap) set up mainly as a personal to-do list where you can follow current progress and priorities if you want.

The full changelog from v0.1 is [here](https://github.com/Serious-Josh/crawler-project/blob/master/crawler/Change_Log.txt)
